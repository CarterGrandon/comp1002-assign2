            <p>Carter Grandon has been interested in programming and computers for many years. He first used Scratch
                when he
                was eight years old and incorporated it into many projects in late elementary school. Carter's high
                school
                computer class taught him about more formal programming. Now he is studying computer programming at
                Georgian
                College, and plans to enter a career in this area in the future.</p>
